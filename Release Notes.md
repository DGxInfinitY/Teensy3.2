This is just a modification of TinyBasicPlus for the Arduino that has most of the functions fixed and eeprom working, this
is my first attempt at porting a simple interpreter so I will try my best. The next step is to make this an actual operating
system with a graphics stack as well as an input handler(So we can use a keyboard.) This will make a fully functional
standalone computer that is based on a Teensy possible. I have a few Ideas in mind. Try this out for yourself and see. It has
a lot of nostalgia from the good old days. Thanks.

# VERSION 1.3 HAS BEEN RELEASED!
Big update to enable some experimental features that have passed testing and are ready for prime time, this version re-enables
EEPROM, TONE, and a new feature for SDCards on your Teensy3.2.

# VERSION 1.2 HAS BEEN RELEASED!
Large update to code and new base off of the v0.14 of the TinyBasicPlus for Arduino adding some good usability updates.

# VERSION 1.1 HAS BEEN RELEASED!
We now have an official name so I might as well put it in the beet sequence for the operating system.
I have added a few minor bug fixes and a boot up sequence(LED on Pin 13 will flash a little). There are a few enhancements
to the EEPROM commands and memory management. That is all for now. Thanks for trying it and have fun.

# VERSION 1.2 HAS BEEN RELEASED!
New code improvements, new functionality for the INPUT command(Thanks to	spairo1741 for testing and notifying me of the issue)
This release is big so take a min to look through some of the the optimizations from the Tiny BasicPlus project.
