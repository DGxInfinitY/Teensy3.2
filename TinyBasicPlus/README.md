# Teensy TinyBasicPlus
This is an interpereter for the Teensy 3.2 that is fully based off the Arduino TinyBasicPlus that can be found here:
https://github.com/BleuLlama/TinyBasicPlus
This has been fully ported to run on the Teensy 3.2 utilizing all the availble memory and eeprom. This makes it
possible to add many libraries and create a fully integrated operating system for the Teensy 3.2. This is 
my first attempt at porting an interperter so sorry if I made any mistakes and lets get going on porting the 
needed libraries for the graphics stack as well as input(keyboard or button/key matrix of some sort.)
