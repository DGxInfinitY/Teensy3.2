This is just a modification of TinyBasicPlus for the Arduino that has most of the functions fixed and eeprom working, this is my first attempt at porting a simple interperter so I will try my best. The next step is to make this an actual operating system with a graphics stack as well as an input
handler(So we can use a keybord.) This will make a fully funcational standalone computer that is based on a teensy possible. I have a few
Ideas in mind. Try this out for yourself and see. It has a lot of nestalga from the good old days. Thanks. Oh and by the way this software cannot be
used for profitable use, it is open source so don't take what isn't yours.
