This is just a modification of TinyBasicPlus for the Arduino that has most of the functions fixed and eeprom working, thisis my first attempt at porting a simple interperter so I will try my best. The next step is to make this an actual operating system with a graphics stack as well as an input handler(So we can use a keybord.) This will make a fully funcational standalone computer that is based on a teensy possible. I have a few Ideas in mind. Try this out for yourself and see. It has a lot of nestalga from the good old days. Thanks. Oh and by the way this software cannot be used for profitable use, it is open source so don't take what isn't yours.

VERSION 1.1 HAS BEEN RELEASED!
Today It's not what I had wanted to release but I think that since we have an official name I might as well put it in the operating system so now we have the complete name in the operating system. I have added a few minor bug fixes and a boot up sequence(LED on Pin 13 will flash a little) That is all for now. Thanks for trying it and have fun.
