This is just a modification of TinyBasicPlus for the Arduino that has most of the functions fixed and eeprom working, this
is my first attempt at porting a simple interperter so I will try my best. The next step is to make this an actual operating
system with a graphics stack as well as an input handler(So we can use a keybord.) This will make a fully funcational
standalone computer that is based on a Teensy possible. I have a few Ideas in mind. Try this out for yourself and see. It has
a lot of nestalga from the good old days. Thanks. Oh and by the way this software cannot be used for profitable use, it is
open source so don't take what isn't yours.

# VERSION 1.1 HAS BEEN RELEASED!
We now have an official name so I might as well put it in the beet sequence for the operating system.
I have added a few minor bug fixes and a boot up sequence(LED on Pin 13 will flash a little). There are a few enhancements
to the EEPROM commands and memory management. That is all for now. Thanks for trying it and have fun.

# VERSION 1.2 HAS BEEN RELEASED!
New code improvements, new functionality for the INPUT command(Thanks to	spairo1741 for testing and notifying me of the issue)
This release is big so take a min to look through some of the the optimizations from the Tiny BasicPlus project.
